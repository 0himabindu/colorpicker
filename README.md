# colorpicker
A basic color picker project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would allow users to select a color from a range of options and display the selected color in a preview box. 
Here's a brief preview of how the project might work:

The HTML code would include a color picker element, which shows a pick color option then it generates a color picker if we place the picker any where on the page then it 
generates its color
The CSS code would style the color picker element and preview box, and define the layout of the page.
The JavaScript code would handle user interactions with the color picker element and update the preview box with the selected color.
